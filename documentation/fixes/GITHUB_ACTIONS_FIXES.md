# GitHub Actions CI/CD Fixes

## Overview

The GitHub Actions workflow has been completely rewritten to be compatible with your Docker setup and workspace structure. The original workflow had several issues that prevented it from working correctly with your microservices architecture.

## Key Issues Fixed

### 1. **Workspace Structure Compatibility**
- **Problem**: Original workflow used npm instead of yarn and didn't understand the workspace structure
- **Fix**: Updated to use yarn workspaces with proper corepack enablement
- **Impact**: Now correctly installs dependencies and builds the monorepo

### 2. **Docker Build Context Issues**
- **Problem**: Original workflow tried to build from individual service directories
- **Fix**: Updated to use root context (`.`) for all builds, matching your Dockerfiles
- **Impact**: Docker builds now work correctly with the workspace dependencies

### 3. **Service Name Mismatches**
- **Problem**: Workflow used incorrect service names (e.g., `redis` instead of `valkey`, `tenant` instead of `tenant-frontend`)
- **Fix**: Updated all service references to match your `docker-compose.yml`
- **Impact**: Services start correctly during testing

### 4. **Node.js Version Compatibility**
- **Problem**: Workflow used Node.js 20, but your project requires Node.js 22
- **Fix**: Updated to Node.js 22 with corepack enabled
- **Impact**: Builds now use the correct Node.js version

### 5. **Docker Build Strategy**
- **Problem**: Original workflow didn't account for multi-stage builds and workspace dependencies
- **Fix**: Implemented proper build strategy that respects your Dockerfile structure
- **Impact**: All services build correctly including the Spanish variant

## New Workflow Structure

### Job 1: `test-workspace`
- Tests the entire workspace using yarn
- Builds types first (required dependency)
- Runs linting across all workspaces
- Tests individual services that have test scripts

### Job 2: `build-docker-images`
- Builds Docker images for all services
- Uses matrix strategy for parallel builds
- Includes both regular and Spanish tenant frontend variants
- Uses proper build context and caching

### Job 3: `test-docker-stack`
- Starts a complete test environment
- Tests service health and connectivity
- Runs integration tests
- Provides detailed logging for debugging

### Job 4: `security-scan`
- Runs Trivy vulnerability scanning
- Uploads results to GitHub Security tab

### Job 5: `build-production-images`
- Builds and pushes production images to GitHub Container Registry
- Only runs on main/master branches
- Supports multi-platform builds (amd64/arm64)

## Service Matrix Configuration

The workflow now correctly handles all your services:

```yaml
- service: tenant-frontend (Dockerfile)
- service: tenant-frontend-spanish (Dockerfile.spanish)  
- service: landlord-frontend
- service: api
- service: authenticator
- service: emailer
- service: gateway
- service: pdfgenerator
- service: resetservice
- service: tenantapi
- service: whatsapp
```

## Environment Configuration

Updated test environment to match your requirements:

- **Database**: MongoDB with proper initialization
- **Cache**: Valkey (Redis-compatible) instead of Redis
- **Node.js**: Version 22 with proper workspace support
- **WhatsApp**: Test configuration for OTP functionality
- **Security**: Proper JWT and cipher keys for testing

## Docker Compose Integration

The workflow now correctly uses your docker-compose.yml:

- Uses `--profile local` for testing
- Starts services in correct order (databases → services → frontends)
- Proper service names (`valkey`, `tenant-frontend`, `landlord-frontend`)
- Correct health check endpoints

## Caching Strategy

Implemented efficient caching:

- **Yarn cache**: Speeds up dependency installation
- **Docker layer cache**: Reduces build times
- **Service-specific cache**: Each service has its own cache scope

## Error Handling & Debugging

Enhanced error handling:

- Detailed logging for each step
- Container log collection on failures
- Health check retries with timeouts
- Graceful handling of missing Dockerfiles

## Files Modified

1. **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** - Completely rewritten
2. **`.github/workflows/ci-original-backup.yml`** - Backup of original

## Testing the Workflow

To test the workflow:

1. **Local Testing**: Use the same commands locally:
   ```bash
   yarn install --immutable
   yarn workspace @microrealestate/types run build
   yarn lint
   docker compose build
   docker compose --profile local up -d
   ```

2. **GitHub Actions**: Push to a branch and monitor the workflow

## Benefits

✅ **Faster builds** - Proper caching and parallel execution
✅ **Better reliability** - Correct service dependencies and health checks  
✅ **Enhanced debugging** - Detailed logs and error collection
✅ **Security scanning** - Automated vulnerability detection
✅ **Multi-platform support** - Builds for both amd64 and arm64
✅ **Production ready** - Proper image tagging and registry push

## Next Steps

1. **Test the workflow** by pushing to a development branch
2. **Monitor the first run** and check for any remaining issues
3. **Adjust timeouts** if needed based on your infrastructure
4. **Add additional tests** as your application grows
