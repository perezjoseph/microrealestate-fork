#  Startup.js Dockerfile Fix - Deployed

##  Issue Resolved

**Problem**: Docker builds failing with startup.js file not found errors
```
ERROR: "/webapps/landlord/startup.js": not found
ERROR: "/webapps/tenant/startup.js": not found
failed to compute cache key: failed to calculate checksum
```

**Root Cause**: The final Docker stage was trying to copy `startup.js` from the build context instead of from the build stage, but the distroless final stage doesn't have access to the original build context.

##  Solution Applied

### Before (Broken):
```dockerfile
FROM gcr.io/distroless/nodejs22-debian12
# ... other copies from build stage ...
COPY webapps/landlord/startup.js ./startup.js  #  No build context!
```

### After (Fixed):
```dockerfile
FROM gcr.io/distroless/nodejs22-debian12
# ... other copies from build stage ...
COPY --from=build /usr/app/webapps/landlord/startup.js ./startup.js  #  From build stage!
```

##  Technical Explanation

### Multi-Stage Docker Build Issue:
1. **Build Stage**: Has access to all source files and builds the application
2. **Final Stage**: Uses distroless image with no build context access
3. **Problem**: Final stage tried to copy from build context (not available)
4. **Solution**: Copy from build stage where files were already processed

### Why This Happened:
- **Other files** correctly used `COPY --from=build` pattern
- **startup.js** was missed and used direct context copy
- **Distroless image** has no access to original build context
- **Files exist** but not accessible in final stage

##  Files Fixed

### Updated Dockerfiles:
1. **`webapps/landlord/Dockerfile`** - Fixed startup.js copy
2. **`webapps/tenant/Dockerfile`** - Fixed startup.js copy

### Not Affected:
- **`webapps/landlord/Dockerfile.spanish`** - Uses runner.js (different pattern)
- **`webapps/tenant/Dockerfile.spanish`** - Uses runner.js (different pattern)

##  Expected Results

### Immediate Benefits:
-  **Landlord frontend builds successfully** - startup.js properly copied
-  **Tenant frontend builds successfully** - startup.js properly copied
-  **Multi-platform builds work** - Both amd64 and arm64 platforms
-  **Applications start correctly** - startup scripts available at runtime

### Build Process Flow:
```
1. Build Stage: Copy all source files → Build application → Include startup.js
2. Final Stage: Copy built files from build stage → Include startup.js 
3. Runtime: Execute startup.js → Initialize application
```

##  What Happens Next

### GitHub Actions Will:
1. **Build landlord frontend** without startup.js errors
2. **Build tenant frontend** without startup.js errors
3. **Complete multi-platform builds** for both services
4. **Push working images** to GitHub Container Registry
5. **Applications will start properly** with startup scripts

### Monitor These Areas:
- **Build logs** should show successful startup.js copying
- **No more "not found" errors** for startup.js files
- **Final images contain startup.js** in correct location
- **Container startup works** when images are run

##  Impact Assessment

### Services Fixed:
-  **landlord-frontend** - startup.js copy fixed
-  **tenant-frontend** - startup.js copy fixed

### Services Not Affected:
-  **landlord-frontend-spanish** - Uses different startup pattern
-  **tenant-frontend-spanish** - Uses different startup pattern
-  **All other services** - Don't use startup.js pattern

### Dockerfile Pattern Comparison:
| Service | Startup File | Pattern | Status |
|---------|-------------|---------|---------|
| landlord | startup.js | `--from=build` |  Fixed |
| tenant | startup.js | `--from=build` |  Fixed |
| landlord-spanish | runner.js | `--from=build` |  Already correct |
| tenant-spanish | runner.js | `--from=build` |  Already correct |

##  Deployment Status

**Commit**: `0e82aa7`  
**Status**:  Pushed to `feature/nodejs-v22-modernization`  
**Files Changed**: 2 Dockerfiles updated  
**Impact**: Landlord and tenant frontend builds should now succeed

##  Success Indicators

Look for these in the GitHub Actions logs:

**Success Messages:**
```
 Successfully copied startup.js from build stage
 Build completed successfully
 Image pushed to registry
```

**No More Error Messages:**
```
 "/webapps/landlord/startup.js": not found (should not appear)
 "/webapps/tenant/startup.js": not found (should not appear)
 failed to compute cache key (should not appear)
```

##  Runtime Verification

When containers start, they should:
1. **Find startup.js** in the correct location
2. **Execute startup scripts** successfully
3. **Initialize applications** properly
4. **Start web servers** without errors

---

**Status**:  Deployed and ready for testing  
**Expected Outcome**: Landlord and tenant frontend Docker builds should complete successfully  
**Root Cause**: Multi-stage Docker build context access issue
