#  Docker Build Context Fix - Deployed

##  Issue Resolved

**Problem**: Docker builds failing with file not found errors
```
ERROR: "/services/resetservice/src": not found
failed to compute cache key: failed to calculate checksum
```

**Root Cause**: The build context was set to the individual service directory (e.g., `./services/resetservice`), but the Dockerfile expects to run from the repository root to access workspace files.

##  Solution Applied

### Before (Broken):
```yaml
- name: Build and push Docker image
  uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
  with:
    context: ./${{ matrix.path }}  # e.g., ./services/resetservice
    # Dockerfile tries to COPY services/resetservice/src (not found!)
```

### After (Fixed):
```yaml
- name: Build and push Docker image
  uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
  with:
    context: .                     # Repository root
    file: ./${{ matrix.path }}/Dockerfile  # Specify Dockerfile location
    # Now Dockerfile can find services/resetservice/src 
```

##  Technical Explanation

### Why This Happened:
1. **Dockerfile Design**: Your Dockerfiles use workspace-relative paths like:
   ```dockerfile
   COPY services/resetservice/src ./services/resetservice/src
   COPY types ./types
   COPY services/common ./services/common
   ```

2. **Wrong Context**: Build context was set to service directory (`./services/resetservice`)
3. **Path Resolution**: Docker looks for `services/resetservice/src` relative to context
4. **Result**: `./services/resetservice/services/resetservice/src` (doesn't exist!)

### How the Fix Works:
1. **Correct Context**: Build context is now repository root (`.`)
2. **Dockerfile Location**: Specified with `file` parameter
3. **Path Resolution**: Docker finds `services/resetservice/src` from root
4. **Result**: All workspace files are accessible 

##  Files Fixed

**Updated**: `.github/workflows/build-microservices.yml`

**Status**: Other workflows (ci.yml, ci-docker-focused.yml) already had correct context

##  Expected Results

### Immediate Benefits:
-  **All microservices build successfully** - No more file not found errors
-  **Workspace dependencies accessible** - Can copy types, common, etc.
-  **Consistent with other workflows** - Matches working CI configurations
-  **Multi-platform builds work** - Both amd64 and arm64 platforms

### Services That Will Now Build:
-  **api** - Can access workspace dependencies
-  **authenticator** - Can access common services
-  **emailer** - Can access types and common
-  **gateway** - Can access all workspace files
-  **landlord-frontend** - Can access commonui and types
-  **pdfgenerator** - Can access workspace dependencies
-  **resetservice** - Can access src directory (was failing)
-  **tenant-frontend** - Can access commonui and types
-  **tenantapi** - Can access types and common
-  **whatsapp** - Can access workspace dependencies

##  What Happens Next

### GitHub Actions Will:
1. **Use repository root as build context** - All files accessible
2. **Specify Dockerfile location explicitly** - No ambiguity about which Dockerfile
3. **Successfully copy all required files** - Workspace structure preserved
4. **Complete multi-platform builds** - Both amd64 and arm64
5. **Push images to registry** - All services available

### Monitor These Areas:
- **Build logs** should show successful file copying
- **No more "not found" errors** in Docker build output
- **All services complete building** without file access issues
- **Images appear in GitHub Container Registry**

##  Impact Assessment

### Workflow Status:
-  **build-microservices.yml** - Fixed (was failing)
-  **ci.yml** - Already correct (working)
-  **ci-docker-focused.yml** - Already correct (working)

### Build Context Comparison:
| Workflow | Before | After | Status |
|----------|--------|-------|---------|
| build-microservices | `./services/resetservice` | `.` |  Fixed |
| ci | `.` | `.` |  Already correct |
| ci-docker-focused | `.` | `.` |  Already correct |

##  Deployment Status

**Commit**: `babda1b`  
**Status**:  Pushed to `feature/nodejs-v22-modernization`  
**Impact**: All Docker builds should now succeed  
**Priority**: High (was blocking microservices builds)

##  Success Indicators

Look for these in the GitHub Actions logs:

**Success Messages:**
```
 Successfully copied services/resetservice/src
 Successfully copied types
 Successfully copied services/common
 Build completed successfully
```

**No More Error Messages:**
```
 "/services/resetservice/src": not found (should not appear)
 failed to compute cache key (should not appear)
```

---

**Status**:  Deployed and ready for testing  
**Expected Outcome**: All microservices should now build successfully  
**Root Cause**: Docker build context mismatch with Dockerfile expectations
