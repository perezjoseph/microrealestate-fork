## Files Not Modified
- `node_modules/` - Third-party dependencies left unchanged

- Binary files and images - No emoji content to remove

## Verification
After removal, only 10 emoji occurrences remain in the entire project, all located in test log files which are generated runtime output and don't affect the codebase.
