# Settlement System in MicroRealEstate

## What is a Settlement?

A **settlement** in MicroRealEstate is a comprehensive record of all financial transactions and adjustments applied to a specific rent period. It's essentially the "final accounting" that determines what a tenant actually owes or has paid for a given month.

## Settlement Components

A settlement consists of four main components:

### 1. 💰 **Payments**
Money received from the tenant
```javascript
payments: [
  {
    date: "20/07/2025",
    amount: 400,
    type: "transfer",        // cash, check, transfer, etc.
    reference: "100",        // transaction reference
    description: ""
  }
]
```

### 2. 💸 **Discounts**
Reductions applied to the rent (promotions, concessions)
```javascript
discounts: [
  {
    origin: "settlement",
    description: "Early payment discount",
    amount: 50
  }
]
```

### 3. 📈 **Debts**
Additional charges added to the rent
```javascript
debts: [
  {
    description: "Late fee",
    amount: 25
  }
]
```

### 4. 📝 **Description**
Notes or comments about the settlement
```javascript
description: "Partial payment received, balance pending"
```

## Settlement Process Flow

### Step 1: Base Rent Calculation
```
Base Rent: 200 DOP
+ VAT: 0 DOP
+ Charges: 0 DOP
= Gross Total: 200 DOP
```

### Step 2: Apply Settlement
```javascript
const settlements = {
  payments: [{ amount: 400 }],  // Payment received
  discounts: [],                // No discounts
  debts: [],                   // No additional charges
  description: ""              // No notes
};
```

### Step 3: Final Calculation
```
Gross Total: 200 DOP
- Payments: 400 DOP
= Net Balance: -200 DOP (CREDIT)
```

## Real Example: "asdasda" Tenant

### Current Settlement (July 2025)
```json
{
  "term": 2025070100,
  "payments": [
    {
      "date": "20/07/2025",
      "amount": 400,
      "type": "transfer",
      "reference": "100",
      "description": ""
    }
  ],
  "discounts": [],
  "debts": [],
  "description": "",
  "total": {
    "preTaxAmount": 200,
    "grandTotal": 200,
    "payment": 400,
    "balance": -200
  }
}
```

## Settlement Types

Payment: 600 DOP
Result: 400 DOP (still owed)
```

### 3. **Overpayment Settlement**
```
Rent: 1000 DOP
Payment: 1200 DOP
Result: -200 DOP (credit)
```

### 4. **Complex Settlement**

## Settlement in the UI

### How Settlements are Created
1. **Landlord enters payment** in the rent management interface
2. **System creates settlement object** with payment details
3. **Contract.payTerm()** processes the settlement
4. **Rent balance is updated** based on settlement

### Settlement Fields in Forms
- **Payment Amount**: How much was paid
- **Payment Date**: When payment was received
- **Payment Type**: cash, check, transfer, etc.
- **Reference**: Transaction ID or check number
- **Promo/Discount**: Any discounts applied
- **Extra Charges**: Late fees or additional charges
- **Description**: Notes about the transaction

## Settlement Impact on WhatsApp Messages

### Before Settlement Fix
```
WhatsApp Message: "Amount due: 200 DOP"
(Ignored the 400 DOP payment)
```

### After Settlement Fix
```javascript
// Calculate net amount from settlement
const netAmount = grandTotal - payment; // 200 - 400 = -200
const finalAmount = netAmount > 0 ? netAmount : 0; // 0 (no payment due)

WhatsApp Message: "Account is current" or no reminder sent
```

## Settlement Best Practices

### 1. **Record Payments Promptly**
- Enter payments as soon as received
- Include accurate dates and references
- Specify payment method

### 2. **Use Proper References**
- Bank transfer IDs
- Check numbers
- Receipt numbers
- Transaction confirmations

### 3. **Document Adjustments**
- Explain discounts clearly
- Justify additional charges
- Add descriptive notes

### 4. **Review Balances**
- Check for overpayments
- Verify calculations
- Handle credits appropriately

## Settlement Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Payment not showing"
**Check**: Settlement payments array
```javascript
// Look for payments in the settlement
rent.payments.forEach(payment => {
  console.log(`Payment: ${payment.amount} on ${payment.date}`);
});
```

### Issue: "Balance incorrect"
**Check**: Settlement calculation
```javascript
const netBalance = rent.total.grandTotal - rent.total.payment;
console.log(`Net balance: ${netBalance}`);
```

### Issue: "WhatsApp showing wrong amount"
**Check**: Amount calculation logic
```javascript
// Should use net balance, not gross total
const amountDue = Math.max(0, netBalance);
```
