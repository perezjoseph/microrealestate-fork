# WhatsApp Service - Archived Files

This directory contains files that were identified as unused in the WhatsApp service codebase during cleanup on July 30, 2025.

## Directory Structure

### 📁 `unused-implementations/`
Alternative implementations that are not currently used:
- `standalone-index-updated.js` - Alternative main entry point
- `message-service-updated.js` - Alternative message service implementation

- `auth-utils.js` - Authentication utilities

### 📁 `unused-utilities/`
Utility files that are not currently used:
- `message-templates.js` - Message template utilities

**Note**: `config-manager.js` was initially moved here but was restored to active codebase as it's actually imported and used by `whatsapp-config-service.js`.

### 📁 `test-files/`

- `test-config-service.js` - Configuration service tests
- `test-config-service-simple.js` - Simple configuration tests
- `test-updated-service.js` - Updated service tests

### 📁 `backup-files/`
Contains the entire `backup/` directory with timestamped backups from July 28, 2025:
- `backup/20250728_175443/` - Complete backup of standalone files

### 📁 `documentation/`
Documentation files moved from root:
- `API.md` - API documentation
- `README.md` - Service documentation
- `AUTHENTICATION_MIGRATION.md` - Authentication migration guide
- `JWT_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md` - JWT integration documentation
- `SECURITY.md` - Security documentation
- `TOKEN_SECRET_MIGRATION.md` - Token secret migration guide

## Restoration

If any of these files are needed in the future, they can be restored by copying them back to their original locations:

```bash
# Example: Restore an alternative implementation
cp archived/unused-implementations/standalone-index-updated.js src/

# Example: Restore authentication component
cp archived/unused-auth-components/auth-unified.js src/standalone/
```

## Analysis Date
- **Archived on**: July 30, 2025
- **Analysis method**: Import dependency tracking and usage analysis
- **Files archived**: ~20 files + backup directory
- **Space saved**: Significant reduction in active codebase complexity

## Current Active Files
After archiving, the active WhatsApp service contains only the files that are actually imported and used by the main entry point (`src/standalone-index.js`).
