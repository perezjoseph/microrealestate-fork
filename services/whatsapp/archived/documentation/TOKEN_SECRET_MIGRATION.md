# Token Secret Migration Note (ARCHIVED - SUPERSEDED)

## Status: SUPERSEDED
**This migration has been superseded by configuration standardization (December 2024)**

## Latest Update: Configuration Standardization
The system has been updated to use **standard environment variable names** across all services, eliminating the need for service-specific prefixes.

### Current Configuration (December 2024)
All services now use the unified naming convention:
```bash
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_secret
REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=your_refresh_secret
RESET_TOKEN_SECRET=your_reset_secret
APPCREDZ_TOKEN_SECRET=your_appcredz_secret
```

### What Changed
- **Removed**: Service-specific environment variable names (e.g., `AUTHENTICATOR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`)
- **Adopted**: Standard naming convention used consistently across all services
- **Simplified**: Docker Compose configuration by removing duplicate variable definitions

## Historical Context (ARCHIVED)

### Original Change Summary
The WhatsApp service was previously updated to use `AUTHENTICATOR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` instead of `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` for JWT validation to ensure consistency with the main authenticator service.

### Original Changes Made
1. Updated configuration to read `AUTHENTICATOR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`
2. Modified authentication middleware to use the new environment variable
3. Updated environment configuration files
4. Updated documentation and examples

### Original Required Actions (NO LONGER NEEDED)
~~1. Update your environment variables:~~
   ```diff
   - ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_secret
   + AUTHENTICATOR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_secret
   ```

### Current State
The configuration has been simplified back to using standard environment variable names, but with proper service coordination to ensure all services use the same token secrets for validation.
