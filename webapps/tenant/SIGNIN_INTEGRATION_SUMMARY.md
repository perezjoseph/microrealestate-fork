# Sign-in Page Integration Summary

## Task 7.1: Replace existing phone input in signin page

### ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

The signin page at `webapps/tenant/src/app/[lang]/(signin)/signin/page.tsx` has been successfully updated to use the new `PhoneInputFormField` component.

## Implementation Details

  }}
/>
