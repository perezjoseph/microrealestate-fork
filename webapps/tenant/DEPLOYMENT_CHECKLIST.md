## Deployment Steps

### 1. Pre-deployment Testing
```bash
# Run full test suite
yarn test

# Run cross-browser tests
yarn test:cross-browser

# Check bundle size impact
yarn bundle-size

# Verify build succeeds
yarn build
```

### 2. Code Review Checklist
- [ ] All PR comments addressed
- [ ] Code follows project conventions
- [ ] No breaking changes introduced
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained
- [ ] Performance impact acceptable

### 3. Staging Deployment
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment
- [ ] Verify all functionality works
- [ ] Test with real WhatsApp OTP flow
- [ ] Check different browsers on staging
- [ ] Validate mobile experience

### 4. Production Deployment
- [ ] Create deployment branch
- [ ] Tag release version
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Monitor error rates
- [ ] Verify functionality post-deployment

### 5. Post-deployment Monitoring
- [ ] Check error tracking for new issues
- [ ] Monitor performance metrics
- [ ] Verify user adoption metrics
- [ ] Watch for browser-specific issues

## Rollback Plan

### Immediate Rollback Triggers
- Critical functionality broken
- Security vulnerability discovered
- Performance degradation > 50%
- Accessibility features not working
- WhatsApp OTP flow broken

### Rollback Steps
1. Revert to previous version
2. Notify development team
3. Investigate root cause
4. Fix issues in development
5. Re-test before re-deployment

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- [ ] Page load time < 2 seconds
- [ ] Component render time < 100ms
- [ ] Bundle size increase < 30KB
- [ ] Error rate < 0.1%
- [ ] Accessibility score > 95%

### User Experience Metrics
- [ ] Form completion rate maintained
- [ ] User satisfaction scores
- [ ] Support ticket volume
- [ ] Mobile usage patterns
- [ ] Cross-browser usage distribution

## Known Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **IE11 Support**: Requires polyfills for full functionality
2. **iOS 13-14**: Virtual keyboard may overlap input field
3. **Offline Mode**: Country data requires internet connection
4. **Large Datasets**: Country list may be slow on very old devices

### Future Improvements
1. Enhanced offline support
2. Better virtual keyboard handling
3. More country-specific validation rules
4. Voice input support
5. Better integration with native mobile apps
