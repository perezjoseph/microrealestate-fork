The cross-browser testing is automated using the `scripts/cross-browser-test.js` script, which:

1. **Feature Detection**: Tests for required browser APIs
2. **Functional Testing**: Validates component behavior
3. **Performance Testing**: Measures load times and responsiveness
4. **Accessibility Testing**: Checks keyboard navigation and screen readers
5. **Mobile Testing**: Validates touch interactions and responsive design

**Workaround**: 
```css
/* Add viewport meta tag */
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover">

/* CSS fix */
.phone-input-container {
  padding-bottom: env(keyboard-inset-height, 0);
}
```

### Internet Explorer 11
**Issue**: ES6+ features not supported.

**Workaround**: Include polyfills:
```html
<script src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6,Array.prototype.includes,String.prototype.includes,Promise"></script>
```

### Firefox Focus Management
**Issue**: Focus outline may not be visible in some Firefox versions.

**Workaround**:
```css
.phone-input:focus-visible {
  outline: 2px solid -moz-focusring;
}
```

```yaml
# .github/workflows/cross-browser-test.yml
name: Cross-Browser Testing
on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - 'webapps/tenant/src/components/ui/Phone*'
      - 'webapps/tenant/src/utils/phone/**'

jobs:
  cross-browser-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

#### Country Selector Not Opening
**Symptoms**: Clicking country selector doesn't open dropdown
**Causes**: 
- JavaScript errors preventing event handlers
- CSS z-index conflicts
- Focus management issues

**Solutions**:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify CSS z-index values
3. Test keyboard navigation (Space/Enter keys)

#### Phone Validation Not Working
**Symptoms**: Valid phone numbers show as invalid
**Causes**:
- libphonenumber-js not loaded
- Incorrect country code detection
- Network issues preventing library download

**Solutions**:
1. Check network tab for failed library requests
2. Verify country detection logic
3. Test with different country selections

#### Performance Issues
**Symptoms**: Slow validation or country search
**Causes**:
- Large country dataset not optimized
- Validation not debounced
- Memory leaks in component

**Solutions**:
1. Enable lazy loading for country data
2. Implement proper debouncing
3. Check for memory leaks in dev tools

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode for detailed logging:

```javascript
// In browser console
window.PHONE_INPUT_DEBUG = true;

// Or in code
localStorage.setItem('phone-input-debug', 'true');
```

This will log:
- Country detection steps
- Validation attempts
- Performance metrics
- Error details

## Conclusion

The PhoneInput component system has been thoroughly tested across multiple browsers and devices. While most functionality works consistently across all supported browsers, there are minor issues with older iOS versions and Internet Explorer 11 that have documented workarounds.

Regular testing and monitoring ensure continued compatibility as browsers evolve and new devices are released. The automated testing pipeline helps catch regressions early in the development process.

For the most up-to-date test results and browser support information, refer to the automated test reports generated by the CI/CD pipeline.
