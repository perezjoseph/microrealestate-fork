# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the WhatsApp phone number input field to provide proper validation, area code selection, and consistent styling with the existing email login option. The enhancement will improve user experience and ensure proper phone number formatting for WhatsApp OTP functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select my country code from a dropdown when entering my phone number, so that I can ensure my WhatsApp number is properly formatted for OTP delivery.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on the phone number input field THEN the system SHALL display a country code dropdown with flag icons
2. WHEN a user searches for a country in the dropdown THEN the system SHALL filter countries by name or code in real-time
3. WHEN a user selects a country THEN the system SHALL automatically populate the area code prefix
4. WHEN the component loads THEN the system SHALL detect the user's locale from browser/computer settings and default to the appropriate country code
5. IF the user is in Dominican Republic THEN the system SHALL default to +1-809 country code
6. WHEN the country code is selected THEN the input field SHALL show the formatted prefix (e.g., "+49 " for Germany)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the phone number input to validate my number format in real-time, so that I can correct any formatting errors before submitting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types in the phone number field THEN the system SHALL validate the number format according to E.164 international standards
2. WHEN an invalid phone number is entered THEN the system SHALL display an error message below the input field
3. WHEN a valid phone number is entered THEN the system SHALL show a success indicator
4. WHEN the user submits the form with an invalid number THEN the system SHALL prevent submission and highlight the error
5. WHEN the phone number exceeds the maximum length for the selected country THEN the system SHALL prevent further input

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the WhatsApp phone input to have the same visual design as the email input, so that the interface feels consistent and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the login form THEN the WhatsApp phone input SHALL have the same height, border radius, and spacing as the email input
2. WHEN the input is focused THEN the system SHALL apply the same focus styles (border color, shadow) as the email input
3. WHEN there is an error THEN the system SHALL display error styling consistent with email input error states
4. WHEN the input is disabled THEN the system SHALL apply the same disabled styling as other form inputs
5. WHEN using dark/light theme THEN the phone input SHALL respect the same theme variables as the email input

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the phone number validation to integrate with the existing WhatsApp OTP system, so that properly formatted numbers are sent to the authentication service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a valid phone number is submitted THEN the system SHALL format it to E.164 standard before sending to the authenticator service
2. WHEN the phone number is formatted THEN the system SHALL store both the display format and E.164 format
3. WHEN integrating with WhatsApp API THEN the system SHALL use the E.164 formatted number
4. WHEN displaying the number back to the user THEN the system SHALL show the localized format with country code
5. WHEN validating Dominican Republic numbers THEN the system SHALL handle the special formatting requirements

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see helpful placeholder text and formatting hints, so that I understand the expected phone number format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the input field is empty THEN the system SHALL display placeholder text showing the expected format for the selected country
2. WHEN a country is selected THEN the placeholder SHALL update to show the specific format (e.g., "123 456 7890" for US)
3. WHEN typing THEN the system SHALL provide real-time formatting hints without restricting input
4. WHEN the number is incomplete THEN the system SHALL show a hint about the expected number of digits
5. WHEN hovering over the country dropdown THEN the system SHALL show a tooltip with country name and code
##
# Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to automatically detect my country based on my browser locale, so that I don't have to manually search for my country every time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the component first loads THEN the system SHALL detect the user's browser locale (navigator.language)
2. WHEN the locale is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically select the corresponding country code
3. WHEN the browser locale cannot be determined THEN the system SHALL fall back to a default country (US +1)
4. WHEN the user manually changes the country THEN the system SHALL remember this preference in localStorage
5. WHEN the user returns to the form THEN the system SHALL use the previously selected country over the browser locale
