# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive dark mode toggle system for the MicroRealEstate platform. The system will provide users with the ability to switch between light and dark themes across both the landlord and tenant web applications, with persistent theme preferences and seamless visual transitions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a landlord or tenant user, I want to toggle between light and dark themes, so that I can use the application in my preferred visual mode and reduce eye strain during different lighting conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the theme toggle button THEN the application SHALL switch between light and dark modes instantly
2. WHEN a user selects a theme preference THEN the system SHALL persist this preference across browser sessions
3. WHEN a user loads the application THEN the system SHALL apply their previously saved theme preference
4. IF no theme preference is saved THEN the system SHALL default to the user's system preference (prefers-color-scheme)
5. WHEN the theme changes THEN all UI components SHALL transition smoothly without visual glitches

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the dark mode to be visually consistent and accessible, so that all interface elements are clearly visible and the application remains fully functional in both themes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dark mode is active THEN all text SHALL have sufficient contrast ratios (WCAG AA compliance - 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
2. WHEN dark mode is active THEN all interactive elements (buttons, links, form fields) SHALL be clearly distinguishable
3. WHEN dark mode is active THEN all icons and graphics SHALL be appropriately styled for the dark background
4. WHEN dark mode is active THEN form validation states (error, success, warning) SHALL remain clearly visible
5. WHEN dark mode is active THEN loading states and overlays SHALL maintain proper contrast

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized theme management system, so that theme changes are consistent across all components and easy to maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing new components THEN developers SHALL use the centralized theme system for consistent styling
2. WHEN the theme system is updated THEN all components SHALL automatically inherit the changes
3. WHEN adding new colors or styles THEN they SHALL be defined in the central theme configuration
4. WHEN building components THEN they SHALL support both light and dark themes without additional configuration
5. WHEN the application loads THEN the theme system SHALL initialize before any components render

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the theme toggle to be easily accessible, so that I can quickly switch themes when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any page THEN the theme toggle button SHALL be visible and accessible
2. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN the theme toggle SHALL be reachable via tab navigation
3. WHEN using screen readers THEN the theme toggle SHALL have appropriate ARIA labels
4. WHEN the theme toggle is activated THEN it SHALL provide immediate visual feedback
5. WHEN hovering over the theme toggle THEN it SHALL show a tooltip indicating the action

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the dark mode to work seamlessly with all existing features, so that my workflow is not disrupted when switching themes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using forms in dark mode THEN all form fields SHALL maintain proper styling and validation states
2. WHEN viewing data tables in dark mode THEN row striping and hover states SHALL remain visible
3. WHEN using modals and overlays in dark mode THEN they SHALL have appropriate backdrop and content styling
4. WHEN viewing charts and graphs in dark mode THEN they SHALL use theme-appropriate colors
5. WHEN using the WhatsApp integration features in dark mode THEN all related UI elements SHALL be properly styled
