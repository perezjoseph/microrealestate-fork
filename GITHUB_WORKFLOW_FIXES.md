# GitHub Workflow Fixes Summary

## Issues Found

The GitHub workflows were failing due to several structural and configuration issues:

### 1. **Incorrect Service Paths**
- **Problem**: CI workflows were looking for frontend services in `services/` directory
- **Expected**: `services/landlord-frontend/` and `services/tenant-frontend/`
- **Actual**: `webapps/landlord/` and `webapps/tenant/`

### 2. **Package Manager Mismatch**
- **Problem**: Workflows were using `npm ci` but project uses Yarn workspaces
- **Evidence**: Root `package.json` has `"packageManager": "yarn@3.3.0"` and `workspaces` configuration
- **Impact**: `npm ci` fails because there's no `package-lock.json`, only `yarn.lock`

### 3. **Node.js Version Mismatch**
- **Problem**: Workflows used Node.js 18
- **Actual**: Project specifies `"engines": { "node": "v20" }` in package.json

### 4. **Missing Service**
- **Problem**: `resetservice` exists in codebase but wasn't included in CI workflows
- **Evidence**: Found in `services/resetservice/` and used in dev/test docker-compose files

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Updated CI Workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml)**

#### Service Path Corrections:
```yaml
# Before
strategy:
  matrix:
    service:
      - landlord-frontend
      - tenant-frontend

# After  
strategy:
  matrix:
    include:
      - service: landlord-frontend
        path: webapps/landlord
      - service: tenant-frontend
        path: webapps/tenant
```

#### Package Manager Fix:
```yaml
# Before
- name: Set up Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: '18'
    cache: 'npm'
    cache-dependency-path: services/${{ matrix.service }}/package-lock.json

- name: Install dependencies
  run: npm ci

# After
- name: Set up Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: '20'
    cache: 'yarn'
    cache-dependency-path: yarn.lock

- name: Install dependencies
  run: yarn install --immutable
```

#### Added Missing Service:
- Added `resetservice` to all workflow matrices
- Updated deployment summaries to include resetservice

### 2. **Updated Build Microservices Workflow (.github/workflows/build-microservices.yml)**

#### Applied Same Path Corrections:
- Updated matrix to use `include` with service name and path
- Fixed Docker build contexts to use correct paths
- Added resetservice to the build matrix

### 3. **Verified Other Workflows**

#### PR CI Workflow (.github/workflows/pr-ci.yml):
- ✅ Already correctly configured with proper paths
- ✅ Uses Yarn properly
- ✅ Frontend services point to webapps directory

## Services Matrix (Final)

| Service | Path | Status |
|---------|------|--------|
| api | services/api | ✅ Fixed |
| authenticator | services/authenticator | ✅ Fixed |
| emailer | services/emailer | ✅ Fixed |
| gateway | services/gateway | ✅ Fixed |
| landlord-frontend | webapps/landlord | ✅ Fixed |
| pdfgenerator | services/pdfgenerator | ✅ Fixed |
| resetservice | services/resetservice | ✅ Added |
| tenant-frontend | webapps/tenant | ✅ Fixed |
| tenantapi | services/tenantapi | ✅ Fixed |
| whatsapp | services/whatsapp | ✅ Fixed |

## Expected Results

After these fixes, the workflows should:

1. ✅ **Successfully install dependencies** using Yarn workspaces
2. ✅ **Find all services** in their correct locations
3. ✅ **Run linting and tests** for each service
4. ✅ **Build Docker images** with correct contexts
5. ✅ **Push images** to GitHub Container Registry
6. ✅ **Complete CI pipeline** without path-related errors

## Next Steps

1. **Commit and push** the workflow changes
2. **Monitor the next workflow run** to verify fixes
3. **Check for any remaining issues** in specific service builds
4. **Verify Docker image builds** are successful

## Additional Notes

- The project structure follows a monorepo pattern with Yarn workspaces
- Frontend applications are in `webapps/` while backend services are in `services/`
- All services have proper Dockerfiles in their respective directories
- The workflows now properly handle the mixed directory structure
